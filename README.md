# Flappy Cat – Scratch Game 🐱

This is a simple arcade-style game made in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), inspired by Flappy Bird.

You control a **cat** using the **up** and **down arrow keys** to avoid obstacles.  
The longer you survive, the faster the game gets – test your reflexes!

## 🧠 About This Project

This project was created as part of my learning journey through the **CS50x** course by Harvard.  
It's one of my first games, made using Scratch to practice programming logic in a visual way.  

I wanted to remake the classic "Flappy" gameplay with a fun cat character.  
It helped me understand game loops, collision detection, and user input handling.
